MultiZone allows to asses probability of exceeding critical temperature for steel constructions. For each sample of calculations OZone3 program by Arcelor Mittal and University of Liege is used.

What MultiZone does:
  - randomization of fires' parameters between set values;
  - mapping fire position to nearest most exposed element;
  - runs OZone3 zone model simulation;
  - writes results of stochastic analysis as CSV file and some distributions.

This script hasn't been finished yet. It still needs corrections and validation with more complex model.
