MultiZone allows to asses probability of exceeding critical temperature for steel constructions. For each single sample of calculations OZone3 program by Arcelor Mittal and University of Liege is used.

What MultiZone does:
  - randomization of fires' parameters;
  - mapping fire position to the nearest most exposed element;
  - running OZone3 zone model simulation;
  - writing results of stochastic analysis as CSV file and some distributions.

This script hasn't been finished yet. It still needs corrections and validation with more complex model.
